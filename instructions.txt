The name score!
This task will be split into two tiny tasks.

1. Ask the user for the first name.
2. Ask the user for their last name.
3. Print the initials of the user's name. As an example "John Snow" should print JS.
4. Create a variable called score. 
5. Using If statement check if the length of the first name is longer than 5 letters, if yes, add 3points to the score, if not, add 5.
6. Do the same thing for the surname!
7. At the end print "Your name has scored x points!" x should be the calculation from your score!
